🚀 Excited to share my latest project for TechnoHacks EduTech! 🚀
I've just completed Task 5, which involved developing a modern, stylish countdown timer with neon effects. This project challenged me to integrate CSS animations, modern font styles, and an interactive interface, all while maintaining a visually captivating neon aesthetic.

💡 Features: 
⭐ Customizable time settings directly on the webpage 
⭐ Neon glow effects around the countdown timer 
⭐ Smooth transitions and eye-catching animations.

Mentor: Sandip Gavit
